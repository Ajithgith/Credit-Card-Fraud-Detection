# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. The data sets contains transactions made by credit cards by cardholders. The dataset comprises 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. Hence, the dataset is highly imbalanced as the fraudulent transactions account for 0.172% of all transactions which clearly indicates the high dominance of non-fraudulent transactions over fraudulent.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA to protect user identities and sensitive features. The only features which have not been transformed with PCA is Time and Amount. Feature Time contains the seconds between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The Feature Amount is the transaction amount. Feature Class is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
